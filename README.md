Complete.

A "task system developed" by me and "Jadson544", made in PHP, with simple ideas (Something generic for practice)

You will enter the idea you want to save, then select whether it is something "Small", "Medium" or "Large" (The level of importance)
Then, after completing the work you can mark it as "completed" and have the option to delete it, if you happen to forget to delete it, it will delete itself after "5 minutes" have passed since your selection.
